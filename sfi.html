          The Students’ Federation of India inherits with pride the
          anti-imperialist, patriotic, secular, democratic, and progressive
          legacy of the Indian people’s struggle for national liberation from
          the British colonial rule. It carries forward the heritage of the
          progressive student movement of our country, which has always
          considered itself an inseparable part of the broader struggle for
          social transformation. It is this legacy that the Students’ Federation
          of India holds aloft in its slogan of “Independence, Democracy, and
          Socialism!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Students’ Federation of India cannot be oblivious of the fact that
          our country had to suffer centuries of colonial slavery and ruthless
          exploitation of foreign imperialism and native feudalism. This led to
          mass-scale poverty, hunger, misery and aggravation of social evils for
          the vast majority of the people and forced them to lead a sub-human
          life. The growing consciousness against the social evils saw the birth
          of a social reform movement led by great rational thinkers. The
          people’s fight to put an end to the British colonial rule and
          feudalism gave birth to the historic national movement for
          independence, in which students played an active role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The formation of the All India Students’ Federation on 12th August
          1936 marked the consolidation of the progressive and radical trends
          within the Indian student community and the beginning of the organized
          student movement in India. The distinctive character of AISF was the
          manner in which it organized within its fold students irrespective of
          their political affiliation under the slogan of anti-imperialism.
          Also, on the world-scale, rapid advances were being made in the USSR
          vis-à-vis the deepening crisis in the industrially advanced capitalist
          countries, which attracted students to the Left ideology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The debates during the formative years of the AISF saw the
          crystallization of the two basic premises that have since guided the
          progressive student movement. The first is the right and the necessity
          of students to organize themselves in defense of their rights and to
          struggle for an education system that would meet the needs of the vast
          majority of our people. The second is the recognition that such a
          struggle can be successful only when combined with the broader
          struggles of other sections of the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The post World War II years, which brought about the decisive defeat
          of fascism, also witnessed massive popular resistance worldwide
          against colonialism. During this period, the national liberation
          struggles in various countries gained momentum, and India was not an
          exception. The AISF stood in solidarity with the mass struggles, at
          times playing a significant role. As a culmination of these struggles,
          our country finally attained political independence. However, these
          were also the times when the communal divide aided by the British was
          deepening that finally led to the partition of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Independence in 1947 brought high hopes that the progressive and
          democratic ideals of the freedom struggle would be realized. In the
          initial decades, significant achievements were registered in building
          up a democratic polity and breaking the colonial stagnation of the
          economy. These, however, were halting and inadequate to meet the needs
          of our vast millions. This was because the process was fraught with
          contradictions — the central one being that the new regime adopted a
          capitalist path of development on the basis of a historic compromise
          with landlordism and imperialism. As­­­­ a result, the stranglehold of
          feudal and semi-feudal relations remained largely intact.
          Consequently, neither economic growth nor democracy could have a
          stable base. In the sphere of education too, while there was some
          progress in the post-independence period, it was in the main limited
          to a privileged few, and the Constitutional directive for universal
          and compulsory primary education remained largely unfulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The different perspectives regarding the policies of the ruling class
          led to a serious rift in the student movement. A section of the
          leadership insisted on supporting the line of the then Congress
          government, thus making student movement tail the government’s
          policies. An opposing section stood for mobilizing the student
          community against the government policies. Due to the dominance of the
          former view, the AISF by the decade of sixties was robbed of the
          potential of struggling against the anti-student and anti-people
          policies of the then Congress government. This forced various state
          unit organizations to function independently. It became essential to
          build a new militant organization moored in the earlier fine tradition
          of the AISF, which led to the formation of the Students’ Federation of
          India [SFI] at an all India conference held from 27-30 December 1970
          at Thiruvananthapuram.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Students’ Federation of India, since its inception, successfully
          championed the slogan of ‘Study & Struggle’ and effectively countered
          the disruptive theory of ‘Student Power’ that ascribed to the student
          community the leadership of social revolution. The Students’
          Federation of India stood firmly against attacks on democratic rights
          and fought against the imposition of emergency. Its slogan of
          “Education for all, Jobs for all” found a strong appeal within the
          student masses of the country, rallying them to the fold of the
          movement and the organization. The Students’ Federation of India
          consistently stood in solidarity with the anti-imperialist national
          liberation movements across the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The introduction of new education policy in 1986 saw a renewed attack
          on the public education system. Students’ Federation of India
          initiated a united struggle against these proposals intended to
          drastically curtail the scope of education in the government sector.
          SFI was able to withstand the anti-reservation stir against the Mandal
          Commission recommendations due to the principled position it had
          taken. It fought in defense of the unity and integrity of the country,
          for communal amity, social justice and made heroic sacrifices in these
          struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Students’ Federation of India is fully aware of the fact that the
          imposition of the neo-liberal economic policies on our country is
          disastrous to the vast majority of the people, which deprives large
          sections of students from access to education and employment. On the
          other hand, the right wing communal forces systematically undermine
          even the modest democratic and secular content of our education system
          to propagate their politics of hate and religious frenzy in an attempt
          to draw a wedge between different communities. Students’ Federation of
          India has been at the forefront of struggles against this dual danger,
          in defense of students’ rights and for upholding the secular,
          democratic character and sovereignty of our Republic
        </p>
        <p>
          The earlier generations of the student community played their proud
          and glorious role in fighting for the achievement of political
          independence from the British. Following their example, it is the
          historic and patriotic duty of our generation of students to take an
          active interest in the struggle for elimination of the evil legacies
          of dependence, backwardness and poverty, and laying the foundation for
          a really free, prosperous, and progressive future for our people. The
          Students’ Federation of India presents before the student community a
          programme that guides them to achieve a democratic, scientific and
          progressive education system. It commits to carry forward the
          uncompromising struggle for the establishment of a socialist society,
          a social order free from all kinds of exploitation.
