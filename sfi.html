        <p>The Students’ Federation of India inherits with pride the anti-imperialist, patriotic, secular, democratic, and progressive legacy of the Indian people’s struggle for national liberation from the British colonial rule. It carries forward the heritage of the progressive student movement of our country, which has always considered itself an inseparable part of the broader struggle for social transformation. It is this legacy that the Students’ Federation of India holds aloft in its slogan of “Independence, Democracy, and Socialism!”
        </p><p>
          The Students’ Federation of India cannot be oblivious of the fact that our country had to suffer centuries of colonial slavery and ruthless exploitation of foreign imperialism and native feudalism. This led to mass-scale poverty, hunger, misery and aggravation of social evils for the vast majority of the people and forced them to lead a sub-human life. The growing consciousness against the social evils saw the birth of a social reform movement led by great rational thinkers. The people’s fight to put an end to the British colonial rule and feudalism gave birth to the historic national movement for independence, in which students played an active role.
        </p><p> 
          The formation of the All India Students’ Federation on 12th August 1936 marked the consolidation of the progressive and radical trends within the Indian student community and the beginning of the organized student movement in India. The distinctive character of AISF was the manner in which it organized within its fold students irrespective of their political affiliation under the slogan of anti-imperialism. Also, on the world-scale, rapid advances were being made in the USSR vis-à-vis the deepening crisis in the industrially advanced capitalist countries, which attracted students to the Left ideology.
        </p><p>
           The debates during the formative years of the AISF saw the crystallization of the two basic premises that have since guided the progressive student movement. The first is the right and the necessity of students to organize themselves in defense of their rights and to struggle for an education system that would meet the needs of the vast majority of our people. The second is the recognition that such a struggle can be successful only when combined with the broader struggles of other sections of the people.
          </p><p>
           The post World War II years, which brought about the decisive defeat of fascism, also witnessed massive popular resistance worldwide against colonialism. During this period, the national liberation struggles in various countries gained momentum, and India was not an exception. The AISF stood in solidarity with the mass struggles, at times playing a significant role. As a culmination of these struggles, our country finally attained political independence. However, these were also the times when the communal divide aided by the British was deepening that finally led to the partition of the country.
          </p><p>
          Independence in 1947 brought high hopes that the progressive and democratic ideals of the freedom struggle would be realized. In the initial decades, significant achievements were registered in building up a democratic polity and breaking the colonial stagnation of the economy. These, however, were halting and inadequate to meet the needs of our vast millions. This was because the process was fraught with contradictions — the central one being that the new regime adopted a capitalist path of development on the basis of a historic compromise with landlordism and imperialism. As­­­­ a result, the stranglehold of feudal and semi-feudal relations remained largely intact. Consequently, neither economic growth nor democracy could have a stable base. In the sphere of education too, while there was some progress in the post-independence period, it was in the main limited to a privileged few, and the Constitutional directive for universal and compulsory primary education remained largely unfulfilled.
        </p><p>
          The different perspectives regarding the policies of the ruling class led to a serious rift in the student movement. A section of the leadership insisted on supporting the line of the then Congress government, thus making student movement tail the government’s policies. An opposing section stood for mobilizing the student community against the government policies. Due to the dominance of the former view, the AISF by the decade of sixties was robbed of the potential of struggling against the anti-student and anti-people policies of the then Congress government. This forced various state unit organizations to function independently. It became essential to build a new militant organization moored in the earlier fine tradition of the AISF, which led to the formation of the Students’ Federation of India [SFI] at an all India conference held from 27-30 December 1970 at Thiruvananthapuram.
        </p><p>
          The Students’ Federation of India, since its inception, successfully championed the slogan of ‘Study & Struggle’ and effectively countered the disruptive theory of ‘Student Power’ that ascribed to the student community the leadership of social revolution. The Students’ Federation of India stood firmly against attacks on democratic rights and fought against the imposition of emergency. Its slogan of “Education for all, Jobs for all” found a strong appeal within the student masses of the country, rallying them to the fold of the movement and the organization. The Students’ Federation of India consistently stood in solidarity with the anti-imperialist national liberation movements across the globe.
        </p><p>
          The introduction of new education policy in 1986 saw a renewed attack on the public education system. Students’ Federation of India initiated a united struggle against these proposals intended to drastically curtail the scope of education in the government sector. SFI was able to withstand the anti-reservation stir against the Mandal Commission recommendations due to the principled position it had taken. It fought in defense of the unity and integrity of the country, for communal amity, social justice and made heroic sacrifices in these struggles.
        </p><p>
          The Students’ Federation of India is fully aware of the fact that the imposition of the neo-liberal economic policies on our country is disastrous to the vast majority of the people, which deprives large sections of students from access to education and employment. On the other hand, the right wing communal forces systematically undermine even the modest democratic and secular content of our education system to propagate their politics of hate and religious frenzy in an attempt to draw a wedge between different communities. Students’ Federation of India has been at the forefront of struggles against this dual danger, in defense of students’ rights and for upholding the secular, democratic character and sovereignty of our Republic
        </p><p>
          The earlier generations of the student community played their proud and glorious role in fighting for the achievement of political independence from the British. Following their example, it is the historic and patriotic duty of our generation of students to take an active interest in the struggle for elimination of the evil legacies of dependence, backwardness and poverty, and laying the foundation for a really free, prosperous, and progressive future for our people. The Students’ Federation of India presents before the student community a programme that guides them to achieve a democratic, scientific and progressive education system. It commits to carry forward the uncompromising struggle for the establishment of a socialist society, a social order free from all kinds of exploitation.</p>
